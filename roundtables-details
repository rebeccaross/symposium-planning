Logistics: 
Size/Timing/Format: There will be 10-12 different roundtables with approximately 15 participants each (literally seated around a table together).   Each roundtable will cover a different topic.  The roundtables will be offered just before lunch and then be repeated after lunch so that all symposium participants will have the opportunity to attend 2 different roundtables.  County teams will be encouraged to split up so that they have representatives from their county at as many roundtables as possible.  Some coordination will be done prior to the roundtables to ensure equal distribution of participants. 

Content/Facilitation/Supervision: Each roundtable will have a Breaking Barriers Advisory Board member to serve as a “BB facilitator/liaison” (who will assist the Roundtable Lead in planning and will take notes and supervise the roundtable).  Each roundtable will have 1-3 “Roundtable Leads” (individuals who have already undertaken significant efforts in their county towards implementing improved programming and collaboration in that area, will assist in planning for the roundtable.  The leads will spend approximately 20 minutes sharing what their county/agency is doing in that area that is novel/innovative, the barriers they have faced and then (with the assistance of the BB facilitator) will facilitate another 5 minutes of table introductions, and 15 minutes of discussion around the table.  Each roundtable will also have “Identified Participants” (individuals who we have specifically reached out to about attending the roundtable and contributing to the conversation).
